# aquarium
This project will be placed on an Arduino Mega, and will be able to control:
- The light (brightness and on-hours)
- The food dispenser. This will be a short cylinder, divided in 8. This will spin one step a day, and the food will fall through the fixed matching hole at the lid of the aquarium.
- The waterflow. Every now and then, 1/3 of the water will be sucked out, and the arduino will turn on a pump, to fill the aquarium from the resevoir.

All these thing will be presented and editable, at the LCD screen by using a rotary encoder. For the timekeeping a DS3132 will be used.
